        <h1>Top 5 Cyber Hygiene Tips</h1>
        <p>
          <strong>Cyber hygiene</strong> is the practice of maintaining your
          digital systems and habits in a clean, secure, and healthy state. Just
          like personal hygiene, regular attention to your cyber habits keeps
          your data and devices protected from threats. Here are the top 5 cyber
          hygiene tips everyone should follow:
        </p>

        <h2>1. Use Strong and Unique Passwords</h2>
        <p>
          Never reuse passwords across platforms. Use a combination of letters,
          numbers, and special characters. Consider using a password manager to
          help you manage and generate strong passwords.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</h2>
        <p>
          2FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second verification
          step — like a code sent to your phone — even if someone gets your
          password.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Keep Software and Systems Updated</h2>
        <p>
          Software updates often contain patches for security vulnerabilities.
          Enable automatic updates whenever possible to keep your system secure
          without having to think about it.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Be Aware of Phishing Attacks</h2>
        <p>
          Phishing emails and websites trick you into giving away sensitive
          information. Always verify the source of an email or link, and avoid
          clicking suspicious links or downloading unknown attachments.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Back Up Your Data Regularly</h2>
        <p>
          Whether it's cloud storage or an external hard drive, keeping backups
          ensures you don’t lose your data in case of a ransomware attack,
          system failure, or accidental deletion.
        </p>

        <p>
          By incorporating these habits into your daily routine, you'll be well
          on your way to protecting your personal and professional digital
          presence. Stay safe out there!
